-- General
Language with nested scopes.
Static type checking.

-- Types

First class types: void, int, bool.
Instantiation of void Variables or pointer to it is forbidden.
(and any level of indirection for that matter, so no void**)

Recursive types: pointers to any type, functions over any type.
While pointers do exists, its arithmetic is strictly forbidden.

Variables have to be defined before use.
Multiple variable declaration is allowed, comma-separated
Ex: int a, b, c;

Pointers to first class types allowed.
ex: int* a; bool* b;

There is no support for structures and there will never be.

-- Functions
Return type is mandatory.
Parameter list can be empty.
Argument list can be empty.
Return statement is mandatory if return type is not void.

-- Objects
No inheritance (to be soon changed).
Closed class structure.

ptr<void (int, int)>
const ptr<const inst>
ptr<const bool>

uptr<int> //unique

To desambiguate certain rules we need to pass context information to it.
This happens for names that are used as user defined types.
While we need those names to be free, that would lead to rules with same
starting symbols. Namely declarations and any expression.

This can be bypassed by tagging those names that refer to types as a diferent
terminal symbol, in my implementation "name_type".

To implement that we need to register the user types in the tokenizer, and from
that point at on, it will return this terminal symbol instead.

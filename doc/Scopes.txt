Notes about scopes implementation.

There are three cases according to how to resolve symbols.

1) Access to member symbol. We only have to look up the hierarchical scope
of the class being accessed.

2) Inside a function not belonging to a class. We only have to look on its
lexical scope.

3) Inside a class' function definition. First we have to look on its own
lexical scope, then if it fails on the hierarchical scope belonging to that
class. This check is allowed to fail, as a symbol could be defined later.

When creating a class' vars or functions, the inherited scope is the
hierarchical scope of the class. However inside a member function definition,
the inherited scope is the lexical scope (or its descendants) of the function
itself.
